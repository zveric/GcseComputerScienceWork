### Name a high level language and low level language and describe the difference between the two types of language
Python, Machine code, Assembly language  
High level languages are easier to write as they are more human readable consequently they need to be converted into low level languages to run.
Low level languages are machine orientated making them hard to program in and read.

### Describe the tools that can be used in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
There are many tools that can be used in an ide including keyword highlighting to make the code easier to read. Along with debugging tools to help to diagnose issues and attempt to fix them.

### Explain the difference between a logic error and a syntax error
Logic errors occur when an error is made with the logic/maths of a program meaning that although the program runs it doesn't perform as expected. A syntax error happens when there is a spelling mistake in one of the keywords of the programming language.

### Explain how  binary search and  liner search are different
Linear search can work with non-sorted algorithms, linear search works by comparing each item in a list with the desired item being searched for and when the item is found the search stops. Linear search is less efficient than binary search but will work on un-ordered lists.  
Binary search works only with sorted algorithms. Binary search works by dividing the list in half to find the midpoint if the midpoint is the desired item the search stops if not, if the value of the lower half is less than the value of the desired item then it is discarded, then the upper half of the list is divided, if the mid-point is the desired item the search stop, if not then the previous steps are repeated until the desired item is found. If the upper half is greater than the value of the desired item then the lower half is selected for the next division. Binary search is more efficient than linear search when used on an un-ordered list but does not work  on an unordered list. 


## Explain the terms below

### Input validation
Input validation involves the checking of an input to make sure it is within the expected range. This stops the program crashing due to invalid inputs.

### Defensive design
Defensive design is the process of designing the program so it is less likely to crash.

### Two factor authentication
Two factor authentication involves the use of two factors to sign into an account. This makes the account much more secure.

### Iterative testing
Iterative testing is when a program is tested at multiple stages.
