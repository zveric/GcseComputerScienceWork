## Types of sorting algorithm

There are are many types of sorting algorithm: 
- bubble sort.
- merge sort.
- insertion sort.

### Bubble sort
1. Look at the first number in the list.
2. Compare the current number with the next number.
3. Is the next number smaller than the current number? If so, swap the two numbers around. If not, do not swap.
4. Move to the next number along in the list and make this the current number.
5. Repeat from step 2 until the last number in the list has been reached.
6. If any numbers were swapped, repeat again from step 1.
7. If the end of the list is reached without any swaps being made, then the list is ordered and the algorithm can stop.

### Insertion sort
1. Compare the 2nd number to the 1st value
2. If the second value is more than the first value no changes are made.
