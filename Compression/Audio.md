MP3 compression works by deleting data that  is decided by the computer to be unnnecesary due to it being out of the human hearing range. This is done via the use of lossy compression, lossy compression is a form of compression where data is removed from the file and is  deleted completely and cannot be recovered when uncompressed, however this results in a greater degree of compression compared to other forms of compresiion such as lossless compression.
