### State what a codec is and give some examples used for digital media (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codec)
Codecs are the building blocks of compression. There are codecs for both lossy and lossless compression. 

Examples of losless codects include apples animation codec.
  
	
### Explain why data compression is important
Compression allows media to be shared over the internet where bandwith coinstraits are an importent factor
	
### Compare lossy and lossless compression - how are they the same and how are they different?

Lossy compression involves the loss of information that is deemed unimportant by the computer leaving the most apposite information.

Lossless compression involves encoding of information into a smaller file format. e.g. ddddddvvvvvkkkkkooooo when compressed would be similar to 6d5v5k5o which can be uncompressed to ddddddvvvvvkkkkkooooo meaning that no information would be lossed

	
### Explain why a static night security camera will be able to compress video to a larger extent than a dashcam in a car. (Hint - think movement)

Because more information will be the same in each frame when the pictures are static
