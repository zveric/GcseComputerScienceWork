You should try and work your way up the grade ladder from grade 1-3
# Grade 1-3
## How many pixels are supported by (a) 480p (b) 720p (c) 1080p HD
a.) 852*480 = 408,960   
b.) 1280*720 = 921,600  
c.) 1920*1080 = 2,073,600  

### For 1080p, and for 24-bits for each pixel, how many bits are needed to store one frame (multiply the pixels by 24)
a.) 49,766,400 bits  


# Grade 4-5
### At 30 frames per second how many bits is this for each second (multiply the bits by 30)
### And, how many bytes is this per second (there are 8 bits in a byte so divide the bits by 8 to get the bytes)
# Grade 6-7
### Compression can reduce overall file size. If you stream or download a HD film how many GB will this need every hour? (use Google to help)
### 1080p resolution takes up about 3GB for every hour of film. How many GB would you need to store all nine Star Wars films?
# Grade 8
## At what resolution and frame rate can the Galaxy S20 and the iPhone record digital video.
### How many hours of video of this quality could you store on a 32 GB SD card?
