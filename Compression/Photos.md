Lossy compression involves the loss of information that is deemed unimportant by the computer leaving the most apposite information.

Lossless compression involves encoding of information into a smaller file format. e.g. ddddddvvvvvkkkkkooooo when compressed would be similar to 6d5v5k5o which can be uncompressed to ddddddvvvvvkkkkkooooo meaning that no information would be lossed
