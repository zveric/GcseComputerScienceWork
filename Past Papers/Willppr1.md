1.b.ii) MB=int(input("how many MegaBytes are in your file?"))
        B = MB * 1000000
        print("There are",B,"Bytes in",MB,"MB")

1.c.i) A full backup would be better as it would full backup all the files, this is better as it does all files at once and would make it faster to recover the lost data if its lost.
