## Q6 
A magnetic hard disk is made up of a disks (platters) coated with a magnetic material. The disks often spin at speeds of up to 7200 rpm. The data is encoded into bita and written onto the surface as changes in the direction of magnetism. the Data can later be read by detecting the direction/changes in magnetism.

## Q7
### Q7.1
the Logic gate is an AND gate
### Q7.2
the logic gate is an OR gate
### Q7.3
NOT logic gates are logic gates, where the input that they are provided will not be thier output
e.g if input is binary 1, then output will be binary 0.

## Q8
### Q8.1
ALU - Arithamtric logic unit , does maths or arithmatic operations
CU - Control Unit, transmits control signals to other parts of the cpu telling them what to do
ACC - Accumulator, holds the results of calculations and operations performed bu the ALU
### Q8.2 
Stages of the fetch excecute cycle
Fetch DECODE Excecute    

## Q9
cloud storage over Local Storage benefits
1 cloud data storgae serves as a more secure way to back up and save data in ordeer to reduce the risk of losing the data due to accidents like a broken local storage drive
2 data stored in cloud storage can be accessed from anywhere world wide as long as youhave an internet connection
3 cloud storage is cheeper per GB than local storgae so it can lead to savings in costs.

## Q10
### Q10.1
System Software acts mainly to manage system resources and operations, it also acts to bridge the gap betwwen application software and hrdware.
Application Software acts to provide an interface inbetween the user and systme software
### Q10.2
Two functions of Operating systems
1 Managing system resources, such as allocating cpu cors or ram usage to specific program or controlling peripherals such as printers.
2 Establishing a user interphace, user interphaces allow for people to interact with and use computers to accomplish tasks and without them most users would not be able to use a computer
### Q10.3
‘New hardware can be installed by downloading it from the web or an
installation disk whereas software requires someone to physically attach it to
the computer.’

two wrongs, 
hardware is installed physically not downloaded,
software is downloaded from the web or data storage drive not physically installed.

## Q11
### Q11.1
LAN ia a Local Area Network, WAN is a Wide Area Network, WAN's work on a much larger scale than a LAN
WAN's are tyically used for large areas or large businesses e.g a councilk/government website, whereas LAN's are often used for home or small busines apllications
