## 1.)
### 1.) a.)
#### 1.) a.) i.) - Explain why the digital video camera needs secondary storage.

a digital video camera needs secondary storage to store the video that it records, this is because storing it in primary storgae is not a viable option because it will not have enough ROM to store the video data, and RAM is volatile so the video data would be lost as soon as the camera turns off/loses power.
#### 1.) a.) ii.) - The digital video camera uses solid state storage.
 Explain why solid state storage is the most appropriate type of storage for the digital
video camera.

- solid state storage is the most approptriate storge type because it doesnt have moving parts, the lack of moving parts makes it so that the portable camera will be resistant to having the data dammaged by physical imopacts such as shaking or drops trhat a disk based storgae such as hdd would be vulnerable to.
- Also as a solid state storgae is a non-volatile storage type it does not lose the data stored in it when the camer is powered down.

### 1.) b.)
#### 1.) b.) i.)The computer has 1GB of storage free.
 Calculate the number of videos that could be stored on the computer if each video was
100MB in size.
 Show your working.

- 1GB = 1000 MB
- 1000/100 = 10 files
#### 1.) b.) ii.) A program needs to calculate the size of files in bytes. The program must:
○ Ask the user to input a file size in megabytes
○ calculate and output the number of bytes this represents in a user friendly format
(e.g. "There are 5242880 bytes in 5MB").
 Write an algorithm using pseudocode to calculate the number of bytes in a given number
of megabytes.

MB = input("What is the size of this file in Megabytes")
B = MB*1000000
print("There are " B "Bytes in this file")

### 1.) c.)
#### 1.) c.) i.) - William can choose between a full or incremental backup.
 Identify the backup method William should use to backup the computer, justifying your
choice.

an incrimantal backup would be a good choice,
this is becuase an incrimental back up would only create backups of changes mad after the last backup.
this meand that there won't be space wasted by having multiple copies of the same dtat on a storage device used for back ups when only one copy is needed.

#### 1.) c.) ii.) - Give one additional utility program William could make use of and describe how he would use it.
