# Compare the positive and negative effects of computing on the environment (6 marks)

Computign can have positive effects on the enviroment, such as email. Emails reduce dammage to the enviroiment by stopping the need for trees to be cut down and and manufactured into paper for letters, which requires the use of chemichal agents such as bleach and release harmfull gasses into the enviroment. Emails also remove the requirement for letters to be transported between the sender and receiver via a postal service which reduce the amount of damage done to the enviroment via carbon emmisions from vehicle ehausts.

Computing also cause dammage to the enviroment. This comes in several forms such mining precious metals and minerals, the minig of metals such as gold, copper and tin for computers and electronics causes dammage to the enviroment due to massive amounts of pollution being released to the surrounding area of mines, this is because when minig for metals large amounts of rock and dirt must be removed for a small amount of metal to be extrracted and these rocks are oftne left to pollute surounding areas through rivers and streams. Computing also cause large amounts e-waste that is not recycleds and is just left to sit in landfill for massive amounts of time due to e-wastes laike plasstics and metal taking millenia to breka downm if they do in deed have any chance of breaking down.

Overall I think computing has had  a neutral impact on the enviroment,because although they have benefitted the enviromnet they have also caused it dammage and degradtion in equal measure.
