 ## Compare the positive and negative effects of computing on the environment (6 marks)

Computers have changed the way that we live forever. This new way of life has changed how we affect the environment. Computers mean that online working is much easier, reducing the need for transport (which relies on the burning of fossil fuels). However, computers use a lot of energy as well as often containing large amounts of precious metals that require excavation to acquire. Computers also don't last for a long time, meaning that they typically end up in landfill after a short period.    

Overall I feel that computers have had a mildly positive effect on the environment, changing people mindset on travel and reducing carbon emissions in some cases. However they hjave profound negative effects that need to be managed.
