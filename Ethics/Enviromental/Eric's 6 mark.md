Computers have changed the way that we live forever. This new way of life has changed how we affect the enviroment. Conmputers mean that online working is much easier reducing the need for transport (whitch relys on the burning of fossil fuels). However computers use alot of energy as well as often containing large amounts of precious metals that require escavation to aquire. computer also dont last for a long time mening that they often end up in landfill. Ovall i feel that computers have had a mildly positive affect on the envirmet changing people mindset on travel and reducing carbon emissions
